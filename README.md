**#Remote Monitoring and Maintenance of Renewable Energy Using Generative AI
Overview**

This project focuses on the development of a remote monitoring and predictive maintenance system for renewable energy installations using generative AI and IoT technology. The system collects real-time data from sensors deployed on solar, wind, and hydro systems and uses machine learning models to predict equipment failures, allowing for proactive maintenance. The goal is to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and sustainability of renewable energy systems, especially in remote or hard-to-reach locations.

**Technologies Used**

Generative AI & Machine Learning:  Used for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection.
IoT Sensors:  Collect real-time data from equipment, including temperature, voltage, and humidity.
ThingSpeak:  Used for cloud-based data storage and real-time monitoring.
Python:  For machine learning model development, data preprocessing, and analysis.
ESP32/Arduino:  For IoT sensor data collection and communication with ThingSpeak.

**Features**

Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors equipment health and environmental conditions.
Predictive Maintenance: Uses machine learning models to forecast maintenance needs, reducing downtime.
Custom Alerts: Proactive notifications based on abnormal data patterns, like voltage spikes, excessive heat, or humidity.
Scalable System: Can be adapted for various renewable energy installations (solar, wind, hydro).
Data Visualization: Displays sensor data trends for analysis.

**Installation Prerequisites**

Python 3.6+
Required Python libraries (listed below)
IoT sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, voltage sensors)
ESP32 or similar microcontroller
ThingSpeak account for data storage

**Data Flow**

IoT sensors (ESP32) collect real-time data (temperature, voltage, humidity).
The data is sent to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi.
The Python script fetches data from ThingSpeak for real-time analysis.
The system uses a machine learning model to classify the equipment's state (normal/abnormal).
Alerts are generated based on anomalies in sensor data (e.g., abnormal voltage, excessive temperature).

**Results The system should:**

Accurately predict abnormal conditions based on sensor data.
Provide real-time alerts for equipment maintenance.
Minimize downtime by predicting and preventing failures.
Offer insights into the performance of renewable energy systems.
